# brushes-redux-3.2-viewer
Could anybody please explain once and for all if, how, or when it will be possible to export the tiny Brushes Redux paintings to a size that allows printing? According to the description with the program, it should be possible with the help of the viewer to export at 6x the resolution. However hard I try it doesn't work. If there is no way, please let me know. It would save me and many other users considerable trouble. I have wasted quite a lot of time to make it work. All my paintings seem to be trapped in the app with no printable export possible. I use Brushes Redux 3.2 on ipad2 and have brushes viewer 1.3.5. installed on Mac high sierra. The message is: "document could not be opened". In the history.json file in the image-container the following error shows up: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data at line 3 column 1 of the JSON dataThis problem seems to be existing several years. It is open source software and one of the best paintings apps in existence - how is this possible??
