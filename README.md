# brushes-redux-3.2-viewer
Please explain if or when it will be possible to export the tiny Brushes Redux paintings to a size that allows printing? According to the description with the program, it should be possible with the help of the viewer to export at 6x the resolution. However hard I try it doesn't work. If there is no way, please let me know. It would save me and many other users considerable trouble. Many of us have wasted quite a lot of time to make it work. All our paintings seem to be trapped in the app with no printable export possible. I use Brushes Redux 3.2 on ipad2 and have brushes viewer 1.3.5. installed on Mac high sierra. The message is: "document could not be opened". In the history.json file in the image-container I see the following error: SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected non-whitespace character after JSON data at line 3 column 1 of the JSON data. This problem seems to be existing several years. It is open source software and one of the best paintings apps in existence. Many painters have been using it only to discover that there is no useful export possible. There are many sad testimonies. How is it possible?? Please help.
