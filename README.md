# brushes-redux-3.2-viewer
Could anybody please explain once and for all if, how, or when it will be possible to export the tiny Brushes Redux paintings to a size that allows printing? According to the description with the program, it should be possible with the help of the viewer to export at 6x the resolution. However hard I try it doesn't work. If there is no way, please let me know. It would save me and many other users of Brushes Redux considerable trouble. I have now thrown away abut three full days of my life. I use Brushes Redux 3.2 on ipad2 and have brushes viewer 1.3.5. installed on Mac high sierra. I get 2 messages on the Mac. One: if I check for updates of the viewer: "Brushes Viewer can't be updated when it's running from a read-only volume like a disk image or an optical drive. Move Brushes Viewer to your Applications folder, relaunch it from there, and try again." But it is already in the App folder, and relaunched. And two: "app not optimized for 64 bit technology." Apart from the ennoying "document could not be opened". This problem seems to be existing by now eight years. It is open source software, and one of the best paintings apps in existence - how is this possible??
